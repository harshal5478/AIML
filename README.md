# 🎓 AI/ML Student Portfolio (PWA-Enabled)

This is my *personal portfolio website, built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and fully converted into a **Progressive Web App (PWA)*. It works offline, can be installed as an app, and demonstrates my understanding of full-stack fundamentals and modern web technologies.
